# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
This is a project on Visualizing sorting Algorithms. A sorting algorithm is used to arrange elements of an array/list in a specific order. Sorting algorithms can also be defined as a set of instructions that take an array or list as input and arrange the items into a particular order.
